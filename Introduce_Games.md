Introduce yourselves Names

- The Story of My Name: 
Where does your name come from?  Share the story of where your name comes from and what it means.  Everyone's name has a surprisingly interesting origin.

- Circle Introduction:
Have the participants stand in a circle. They have two
minutes to find out who the person to their left is and some interesting facts about
them. Each person will introduce the person on their left to the whole group. Almost
everyone who's been to a youth group will have played this at some point, it's not only
easy to learn but it's fun, informative and can be used with just about any kind of group,
it's also great for use with a new group of people who don't know each other very well,
and a base for future friendships.


- 2 Truths & a Lie (20 min)
  - A different kind of get-to-know-you activity which is engages and challenges each group member in a fun way
  - Particularly useful as an icebreaker, e.g. can be used as a opener for a workshop/conference.
  - For large groups (e.g., 30+), it is best to split into smaller group sizes.
  - Hand out cards or paper and pens (or if participants bring their own, that's fine)
  - Explain that in this activity each person write two truths and a lie about themself and then we will try to guess each other's lie.  The goal is to: a) convince others that your lie is truth (and that one of your truths is the lie) and b) to correctly guess other people's lies.
  - Allow approx. ~5+ minutes for writing 2 truths & a lie - this isn't easy for a lot of people - there will some scribbling out, etc.  The slower people will probably need to be urged along to "put anything you can think of" down.  Allocate 5-8 minutes, but you will probably need to urge people along.
  - Announce that we will now walk around and chat to one another, like a cocktail party, and ask about each other's truths and lies.  The goal is to quiz each about each statement to help determine which are the truth and which is the lie, whilst seducing other people into thinking that your own lie is a truth.  At the end we will caste our votes and find out the truth.
  - Emphasize that people should not reveal their lie, even if it seems others might have guessed.
  - Allow min. 10-15 minutes of conversation time.
  - Gather together in a circle.  Start with one person who reads their three statements aloud (to remind everyone).  Then read the statements again, stopping to allow a vote for each one.  e.g., "I am Turkish.  Who thinks that is a lie?  [Vote]  I am vegetarian.  Who thinks that is a lie?  [Vote]  I have a metal pin in my right leg.  Who thinks that is a lie?  [Vote].  OK, my lie was "I am vegetarian.""  The facilitator will need to help each person out, especially intially until the basic format is understood.  The facilitator may add drama and reinforcement, etc. for correct guesses, tricky statements, etc.
  - The exercise can be run competitively, e.g., count up how many correct guesses of other people's lies and take away the number of people who correctly guesses your own lie.  Highest score wins (honesty counts!).

- Cocktail Party: 
Group members pretend to  meet in different scenarios, e.g., at the beach, a cocktail party, etc.  A fun way to mill around and people meet new people.
